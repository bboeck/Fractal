# Fractal
In 1987 a short basic program was published in the issue 7/8'87 of the PC Magazin Plus which draws the appleman in 3D. In 4 colors and full CGA resolution (320x200).

I modified the program as a 9 year old and had a lot of fun with it.
My mother, however, much less, she had to type for me due to lack of own typing skills. 
Thanks again for that ;)
On the family XT with 4,7 MHz and 640KB RAM it took about 20 minutes to calculate a picture.
While cleaning up, I stumbled across this old magazine again and decided to put the program on the web.
